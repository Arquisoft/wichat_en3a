* User: the player interacts with our application by using the front-end of the application to sign up, log in,
and play different games (question game, akinator style game, and wordle game)

* Application : our application allows the player to play the games, and it will interact by using queries to get the
questions, answer and incorrect options from WikiData, and getting hints for the different games from the LLM.
It also allows the user to authenticate and see their score.

* Login and SignUp: authentication system for the game.

* Scores: score system that allows users to see their past games statistics.

* WikiData: API to extract the information for generating the different questions, options and answers.

* LLM: API to ask to an AI for hints related to the question shown to the user.


=== Technical Context

The application is deployed using Docker with Oracle. The whole application:
The user interacts with the front-end of the application. It will be a SpringBoot project called webapp that will contain the user
interfaces and ask the other parts/services of the application the different data that it needs. So, it acts as a Controller.

The services will be:

* UserService for the Login, SignUp and Score system. It will interact with the database (MongoDB) by using the TCP/IP protocol and sending queries in JSON format for the user authentication, and their statistics for the different games he played.

* WikidataService which will interact directly with Wikidata by using the HTTPS protocol and sending some queries in SPARQL.

* HintService which will interact directly with the LLM by sending some queries and instructions using the HTTPS protocol and https://github.com/googleapis/java-genai[Google Gen AI Java SDK].

The services are deployed as images in Docker with Oracle, and are different SpringBoot projects that act as REST APIs.
