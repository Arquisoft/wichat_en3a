== Solution Strategy

=== Technology breakdown

==== Backend
[options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Reasons
| Use https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot] at the project | We are going to use SpringBoot at the project because:

- It gives us a lot of functionality already implemented so that we don't have to implement it ourselves.

- It allows us to use Java, which we are very used to and prefer over JavaScript.
| https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] as a database system | We will use MongoDB because:

- It's already integrated in the user and authentication service

- It's the more popular non-relational database, and has a more or less simple syntax

==== LLM
[options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Reasons
| https://ai.google.dev/[Gemini] as the LLM for generating hints | We will use Gemini because:

- It has a free api usage with limitations, but it is enough for our application.

- It's already integrated in the llm service.

- It has a way to handle hallucinations and errors.

- It allows us to send the instructions for how the LLM should behave each time the user asks the LLM something. This also means that the user can't just ask the LLM to ignore its instructions and give them the correct answer.
|===

==== Deployment
[options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Reasons
| https://www.docker.com/[Docker] with https://azure.microsoft.com/[Azure] for deploying the application | We will use Docker with Azure because:

- Docker containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).

- This portability allows seamless deployment on Azure, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

=== Toplevel decomposition

[options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Reasons
| MVC architectural pattern | We will use MVC for the project because:

- It allows us to divide the application into model, view and controller and are less coupled
| Microservices architecture | We will use the microservices architecture because:

- We can divide the project into independent services (other projects) that can be reusable
|===

=== Organizational breakdown
Scrum,  Pull requests revision,

[options="header"]
|===
| Decision | Reasons
| Weekly meeting | Up until this moment we are meeting only once a week because:

- We can work together at class in person

- We can be up to date with the things done, discuss the future decisions and see what problems each teammate have

- Everyone can have a moment to express themselves

| WhatsApp group | We are using a WhatsApp group as a secondary way of communication because it's a common application for all of us and it can be accessed anywhere.
| GitLab Flow as branching strategy | The branching strategy ‘GitLab Flow’ will be used by the development team because:

- It is the branching strategy that fits better the team and project characteristics.

- It's simple as it only has 3-4 types of branches. It's less complex than Gitflow but more structured than Github Flow.

- It's well divided, and allows simultaneous work on different features

|===

=== Quality decisions

[options="header"]
|===
| Attribute pursued | Choice
|Compatibility & Transferability | The system has been developed to correctly work no matter the browser or device guaranteeing a fluid experience. We are using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap which assure that the design and features look and act similarly across the different platflorms.
|Usability & Operability| The UI has been designed taking into account usability principles taught to the team. The team has also made sure that the users can guess what the buttons all around the application do without much problem.
