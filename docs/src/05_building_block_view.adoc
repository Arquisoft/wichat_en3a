** Motivation **

This is a very general overview of our system to understand how it works and services has/uses in a simple way.

** Contained Building Blocks **

As we described, before it's composed by:

* An User that will interact with our application.

* Our application will interact with different services: Login and SignUp, Scores, WikiData and LLM.

** Important Interfaces **
The user interacts connects to the application and can play the game by making

** Motivation **

This gives a little more deep that help us to understand the architecture and how we structured.

** Contained Building Blocks **

* The WebApp provides the user interface of our system. It could be considered the Application, but it works as a Controller,
that is an intermediate between the User and Services provided.

* UserService is a REST API that provides all the functionality related with the users (login, sign up, scores of users).
It also, communicates with the database for making the authentications and retrieving or storing scores of the users.

* WikidataService is a REST API that is in charged of generating the questions from Wikidata, and stores them in the database.

* HintService is a REST API that is in charged of communicating with the LLM (it's an intermediary), so it sends prompts to the LLM with some context.

** Important Interfaces **
The webapp acts as a Controller and communicates with the rest of services

=== Level 2

* The Frontend is what the user will interact with, the part the user will be able to see. It will send requests to the GameService and UserService. 

* The GameService handles the game, it will ask for questions and hints, and send them to the Frontend, then process the answers. It will also interact with the UserService to keep track of scores and other user information related to the game. 

* The UserService is in charge of logging in the user and keeping track of all their relevant information by storing it and retrieving it from the Database. 

* The HintService will be used to interact with an LLM in order to generate hints. 

* The WikiDataService will be used to generate questions based on data extracted from WikiData.

* The Database will store information used in the system such as the user login details, the previous games and scores.
