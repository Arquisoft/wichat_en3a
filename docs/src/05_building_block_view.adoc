* The Frontend is what the user will interact with, the part the user will be able to see. It will send requests to the GameService and UserService. 

* The GameService handles the game, it will ask for questions and hints, and send them to the Frontend, then process the answers. It will also interact with the UserService to keep track of scores and other user information related to the game. 

* The UserService is in charge of logging in the user and keeping track of all their relevant information by storing it and retrieving it from the Database. 

* The HintService will be used to interact with an LLM in order to generate hints. 

* The QuestionService will be used to generate questions based on data extracted from WikiData.
