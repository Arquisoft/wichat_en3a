**Motivation**

The above diagram shows the initial version of the architecture and the division between its components.
We will be using a microservices architecture, with a main server that the user directly interacts with and several
services that this server interacts with. One of these services interacts with Wikidata to get questions, another interacts
with the database to store user information and another interacts with Gemini to get hints and more.

**Quality and/or Performance Features**
By separating the architecture in this way we have a lot of separation, which provides flexibility,
expandability and scalability. The services could be changed and as long as the API remains the same, everything would keep working.

**Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure**

* The webapp is in the webapp folder
* The userService is in the userService folder
* The wikidataService in when wikidataService folder
* The hintService in the hintService folder
* The database runs in Docker, and upon WikiData service starting it will be filled with questions
* WikiData is an external component, which is key to our application but is not something we can change, it's
important to keep up with any API changes and to keep in mind that information there might be wrong our outdated.
* The Grafana configuration is in the Grafana folder
* The Prometheus configuration is in prometheus.yml
