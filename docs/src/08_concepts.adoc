**Classes**

* Question: Represents a question entity. It contains the question text, a list of possible answers, the correct answer, and optionally an image relevant to the question. Each question is associated with a question category.
* User: Represents a user, storing personal information such as name, email, and password.
* Answer: Represents an answer entity. It contains the answer text and is linked to an answer category.
* Score: Represents the score for a game session. It records key information such as the user who played, the game category, the number of correct and incorrect answers, and the time taken to answer the questions. It's linked to a User

**Enums**

* QuestionCategory: Defines the categories of questions. The current available categories are Pop Culture, Biology, Sport, and Geography.
* AnswerCategory: Defines answer categories related to the question categories, such as Flag, Brand Name, F1 Team, Monument Name, Animal Lifespan, and others

=== User Experience (UX)
As our goal is to develop a game, the user experience has a huge rol, as players must enjoy playing.
To achieve this, we developed interfaces that are intuitive, with instructions and colorful.

=== Safety and Security concepts
We use Spring Boot Security features to require users to log in before accessing the application.
During user registration, we employed PasswordEncoder to encrypt passwords, ensuring that raw passwords are not stored in our database.

=== Architecture and design patterns
We chose to use Spring Boot for both the backend and a Thymeleaf-based frontend, following the MVC pattern to keep the
codebase clear and well-organized.
Also, we used microservices to have a project divided in clear and independent modules that are reusable.

We use MongoDB as our database system to store information about users, scores, answers and questions.

=== Development concepts
We will deploy in Oracle using continuous integration.

=== Our decisions
To ensure the application's robustness and high availability, we adopted a microservices architecture with a clear client-server division.
A key design objective was to make the application independent of external services such as Wikidata and the LLM. This ensures that even if these services experience timeouts, our application remains available to users without interruption.
To further minimize delays caused by Wikidata, we implemented multithreaded access when retrieving data, improving performance significantly.
This modular approach enhances resilience, scalability, and fault tolerance while keeping a clean separation of concerns between data fetching and data usage.
