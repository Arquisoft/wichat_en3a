== 10. Quality Requirements

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as a quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural decisions, you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them, concrete, and measurable.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree
All the quality requirements for the systems are:

Here there are the rest of quality attributes that we don't considered as much important as the mentioned before.

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| **Quality Attribute** | **Requirement**

| **Performance efficiency**
| Since the main game relies on generating questions and showing an image, the application should be able to generate them efficiently and to render the image within a short time.
For this, the questions are loaded when the application is first deployed so there is no need to query Wikidata each game. For the images, we use the ones provided by WikiData and display them
with a resolution low enough to guarantee a short waiting time.

| **Maintainability**
| While the end users won't see it, we want to make sure that our application's code is maintainable and easily modifiable so new features can be easily added without the need to change a lot of the previous code.
To ensure this, we chose a modular architecture (MVC and microservices) to reduce coupling between elements and included tests to verify that they work properly in case there are modifications.

| **Compatibility**
| The application has been designed to work on most moder browsers to ensure that the users can access it and use it regardless of the technology they use to connect to it.
To ensure this, we did a responsive design and using standard technologies (CSS, JavaScript, HTML...)

| **Transferability**
| Since the application is deployed using Docker, it can be easily transferred to a new machine or cloned into multiple ones to improve scalability

=== Quality Scenarios
Some quality scenarios are:
[cols="3,5,5"]
|===
| **Quality attribute** | **Scenario** | **Priority**

| **Usability**
| When the user enters into the app for the first time, he must understand how to play each game in less than 5 minutes.
| High, High
| **Security**
| When the user tries to enter the game without registering, it's access is denied
| High, High
| **Reliability**
| When the LLM isn't available, the system should keep working without failing
| Medium, High
| **Maintainability**
| When we want to change the LLM used, only the part of the system in charged of the LLM should change, and don't affect the overall system
| Low, Medium
