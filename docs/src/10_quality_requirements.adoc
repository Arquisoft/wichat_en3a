== 10. Quality Requirements

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as a quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority, which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural decisions, you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them, concrete, and measurable.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

The quality tree below provides an overview of the primary and secondary quality requirements for the application.

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| **Quality Attribute** | **Requirement**

| **Performance**
| - The system should generate a question, its possible answers and the image within a short time.

| **Availability**
| - A failover mechanism should allow hint generation to respond or give a controlled answer even if the LLM API is temporarily unavailable.


| **Security**
|  - User data (e.g., progress history) should be securely stored. +
  - The system should prevent unauthorized access to API keys.

| **Maintainability**
| - The codebase should follow modular architecture principles, ensuring ease of modification and debugging. +
  - The system should be correctly tested.

| **Usability**
| - The web interface should be intuitive and accessible for everyone.

| **Reliability**
| - The hint system should provide accurate and relevant hints and prevent the LLM to retrieve the answer directly. +
  - The system should handle incorrect answers and provide meaningful feedback to users.

=== Quality Scenarios

[cols="3,5,5"]
|===
| **Scenario Type** | **Description** | **Expected System Response**

| **Performance**
| The user plays the game and requests a question.
| The system generates the possible answers and shows an image wasting little time.

| **Availability**
| The LLM API is temporarily unavailable.
| The system does not break and provides a good feedback to the user.

| **Maintainability**
| A new hint-generation strategy is introduced.
| The system integrates it with minimal modifications due to its modular architecture.

| **Usability**
| An user that is not used to play games or use computers tries the game.
| The interface is clear and intuitive so the user has no problem playing the game.
