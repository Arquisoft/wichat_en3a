|*Risk* |*Description*
|Integration with Wikidata a|

Extracting meaningful and accurate data from Wikidata for generating
questions and hints may be challenging. Data inconsistencies, missing
attributes, or outdated information could lead to incorrect questions or
hints.


|LLM Accuracy a|

The LLM may generate incorrect or misleading hints (hallucinations).


|Scalability of the System a|

As more users register and play, the backend (Wikidata API, LLM API, and
database) may face performance bottlenecks.


|User Authentication and Data Privacy a|

User registration and historical data storage introduce potential
security vulnerabilities (e.g., data leaks, unauthorized access). Compliance with GDPR or other privacy regulations
is also a concern.

|Question Repetitiveness a|

Users may encounter repetitive questions. A system for tracking previously used questions and ensuring diversity in
topics is necessary.

|Time-Limited Question Challenges a|

Implementing a real-time timer for answering questions may lead to synchronization issues across different devices and
network conditions, potentially causing an unfair experience. Latency compensation mechanisms should be considered.
