|===
|*Risk* |*Description*
|User Authentication and Data Privacy | User registration and historical data storage introduce potential
security vulnerabilities (e.g., data leaks, unauthorized access). Compliance with GDPR or other privacy regulations
is also a concern.

|Integration with Wikidata |

Extracting meaningful and accurate data from Wikidata for generating
questions and hints may be challenging. Data inconsistencies, missing
attributes, or outdated information could lead to incorrect questions or
hints.

| LLM Availability | Since we are relying on a free AI model, the amount of requests the application can make is limited. If the number of players is too great, the parts of the application reliant on the AI may not work

|Scalability of the System a|

As more users register and play, the backend (Wikidata API, LLM API, and
database) may face performance bottlenecks.

|LLM Accuracy |

The LLM may generate incorrect or misleading hints (hallucinations).

|Question Repetitiveness |

Users may encounter repetitive questions. A system for tracking previously used questions and ensuring diversity in
topics is necessary.

|Question quality  |
Due to the format of some of the questions, some of them may seem "stupid" (asking the name of a logo while displaying the name in the image). As such, an effort should be made to indentify this questions and resolve any issues they may have.


|Time-Limited Question Challenges |

Implementing a real-time timer for answering questions may lead to synchronization issues across different devices and
network conditions, potentially causing an unfair experience. Latency compensation mechanisms should be considered.
