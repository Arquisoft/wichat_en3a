== Testing & Monitoring
A wide range of tests were done to ensure that our system work as expected and ensuring a code coverage greater or equal to 80%.
Also, we monitor our system using

=== Functional testing
We implemented acceptance tests to verify that the product meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected from the user's perspective. These tests were primarily conducted using Selenium, with some scenarios defined in Cucumber.
Some scenarios that were tested with acceptance tests are login, signup and logout.
In addition, we performed end-to-end (E2E) tests using Selenium to simulate real-world user scenarios and validate the behaviour of the user interface. Some of them are game, signup, login and score tests

===  Unitary testing
Unit tests were implemented to verify that both users and the application behave as expected and do not perform unintended actions.
We used JUnit 5 for writing the tests, and Mockito for mocking dependencies where isolation was required.
These unit tests also contributed to improving code coverage, in line with our quality gate requirement of 80%. Right now, the code coverage stands at 85.1%.

=== Load testing
Load testing was done to ensure the fulfilling of the performance quality goals that we defined in the first section of this documentation.
It was done in a laptop in localhost with 12 cores and 16GB RAM.

The tests don't cover the whole application as we weren't able to cover the artificial intelligence section due to the limit in requests of Gemini.

We did two different tests for this:

* The first one was a simple one were we just made the users log in, check their scores and log out.
* The second one

As you can see the application can handle up to 500 simultaneous users without too muc hassle

The second one was a bit more elaborated as we made the users make the same thing as before but also play a round of the game in the biology category

In this case you can see that the application even though it has a bit more failed requests it handles more than 3000 users simultaneously so that increase is expected
